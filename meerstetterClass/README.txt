1. put the .zip in your ~/Arduino/libraries folder
2. import the library
3. FOR SOME CRAP REASON ! need to also import the SoftwareSerial library (even though its header file is in the meerstetterRS485 library
4. AND !!   for ANOTHER CRAP reason, need to use fully qualified paths on the includes for RS485Serial and SoftwareSerial in the meerstetterRS485.h file  .. unfucking believable ..
